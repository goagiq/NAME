# Name Generation System

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to generate new identities for individuals seeking to establish a new persona. The system focuses on creating culturally appropriate, historically accurate names based on specific demographic and geographic parameters.

## Phase 1: New Identity Generation System

### Core Requirements
The system generates complete identities including First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name based on the following user inputs:

#### Required User Inputs
- **Sex**: Male, Female, Non-binary
- **Location**: Country and region where they currently live (e.g., Spain, United States, Canada)
- **Age**: Current age of the person
- **Occupation**: Current or desired profession/persona
- **Race/Ethnicity**: Cultural and ethnic background
- **Religion**: Religious affiliation or background
- **Birth Year**: Year of birth (used to find historically popular names for that period)

#### Name Generation Logic
- **First Name**: Generated based on sex, birth year (popular names from that era), region, and cultural background
- **Middle Name**: 
  - Optional based on regional customs
  - Some regions have very long middle names (e.g., Spanish naming conventions)
  - Some cultures don't use middle names at all
- **Last Name**: 
  - Generated based on regional naming patterns
  - Supports hyphenated last names where culturally appropriate
  - Considers family naming traditions by region

#### Regional Considerations
- **Spain**: Long names with multiple middle names, maternal and paternal surnames
- **United States**: Typically one middle name, various ethnic naming patterns
- **Asia**: Often no middle names, different surname-first conventions
- **Middle East**: Patronymic naming systems
- **Europe**: Varied traditions by country and region

### Validation System

#### Criminal/Terrorist Watchlist Validation
- **Primary Check**: Validate generated names against government watchlists of known criminals and terrorists
- **Sources**: 
  - OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) sanctions lists
  - FBI most wanted lists
  - Interpol red notices
  - National criminal databases
- **Action**: If any name component matches a watchlist entry, the entire name is rejected and a new name is generated

#### Accepted Names Database
- **Purpose**: Prevent reuse of previously accepted names
- **Storage**: Maintain database of all accepted names with metadata
- **Validation**: Check generated names against accepted names database
- **Action**: If name exists in accepted database, generate alternative name

#### Validation Workflow
1. Generate name based on user parameters
2. Check against criminal/terrorist watchlists
3. Check against accepted names database
4. If either check fails, regenerate name
5. If validation passes, present name to user
6. Upon user acceptance, add to accepted names database

### Database Schema for Phase 1

```sql
-- Core identity table
identities (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    middle_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    sex TEXT NOT NULL,
    location TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER NOT NULL,
    occupation TEXT NOT NULL,
    race TEXT NOT NULL,
    religion TEXT NOT NULL,
    birth_year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    generated_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    accepted_date TIMESTAMP,
    validation_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'
)

-- Watchlist entries (for reference)
watchlist_entries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    middle_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    source TEXT NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT,
    added_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

-- Validation results
validation_results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    identity_id INTEGER REFERENCES identities(id),
    watchlist_check BOOLEAN,
    accepted_names_check BOOLEAN,
    validation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT
)

-- Accepted names (prevent reuse)
accepted_names (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    middle_name TEXT,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    accepted_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    original_identity_id INTEGER REFERENCES identities(id)
)
```

### User Experience Flow

#### Input Collection
1. **Sex Selection**: Dropdown with Male/Female/Non-binary options
2. **Location Input**: Country dropdown + region/state field
3. **Age Input**: Numeric input with validation
4. **Occupation Input**: Text field with autocomplete suggestions
5. **Race/Ethnicity**: Dropdown with cultural/ethnic options
6. **Religion**: Dropdown with religious options (including "None")
7. **Birth Year**: Year picker with reasonable range (1900-present)

#### Name Generation Process
1. User submits all required information
2. System generates multiple name options (3-5 alternatives)
3. Each name is validated against watchlists and accepted names
4. Valid names are presented to user with cultural context
5. User selects preferred name
6. Selected name is recorded in accepted names database

#### Name Presentation
- Display full name (First Middle Last)
- Show cultural context and meaning
- Explain naming conventions used
- Provide pronunciation guide if needed
- Show historical popularity for birth year

                **self.dedicated_ports
            }
        return self.service_ports
```

   # Start MCP server with dedicated port
   python -m mcp.server --port 8500
   ```
2. **Verify MCP Installation**: Server should be running on `http://localhost:8500/mcp`

### Service Startup and Port Management
```python
# Service startup script: scripts/start_services.py
from config.ports import PortManager
import subprocess
import time

def start_all_services():
    """Start all services with proper port management."""
    port_manager = PortManager()
    ports = port_manager.get_all_ports()
    
    print("Starting services with the following ports:")
    for service, port in ports.items():
        print(f"  {service}: {port}")
    
    # Start services in order
    services = [
        ('ollama', f"ollama serve --port {ports['ollama']}"),
        ('mcp', f"python -m mcp.server --port {ports['mcp']}"),
        ('database', f"postgres --port {ports['database']}"),
        ('redis', f"redis-server --port {ports['redis']}"),
        ('fastapi', f"uvicorn src.main:app --port {ports['fastapi']}"),
        ('frontend', f"npm start -- --port {ports['frontend']}")
    ]
    
    for service_name, command in services:
        print(f"Starting {service_name}...")
        subprocess.Popen(command.split())
        time.sleep(2)  # Allow service to start
    
    print("All services started successfully!")
    return ports
```

### Strands Agent Configuration
```python
# Configuration for different name categories
AI_MODELS = {
    "person": "llama3",
    "project": "llama3", 
    "code": "codellama",
    "mission": "llama2",
    "place": "llama3"
}

# Strands agent factory
def create_agent(category: str) -> Agent:
    model_id = AI_MODELS.get(category, "llama3")
    ollama_model = OllamaModel(
        host="http://localhost:11434",
        model_id=model_id
    )
    return Agent(model=ollama_model)
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow
The name generation process uses a collaborative swarm of specialized agents:

1. **Locality Agent**: Understands culture, ethnicity, language, and religion for specific regions
2. **Linguistic Expert**: Handles phonetics, etymology, and language patterns for name creation
3. **Validation Agent**: Checks names against watchlists, used names, and avoided names while ensuring cultural acceptability
4. **Creative Director**: Generates innovative and memorable names based on requirements

**Workflow Process:**
1. User submits name generation request with parameters
2. Locality Agent analyzes cultural context, naming conventions, and religious requirements
3. Linguistic Expert suggests phonetic and linguistic patterns appropriate for the culture
4. Creative Director generates initial name candidates based on cultural guidelines
5. Validation Agent screens candidates against:
   - Criminal/terrorist watchlists
   - Previously used names database
   - Avoided names list
   - Cultural acceptability for location, culture, and religion
   - Special naming requirements (mother's/father's names, hyphenated names due to marriage)
6. Final names are ranked and presented to user

#### Locality Agent Responsibilities
- **Cultural Analysis**: Deep understanding of naming conventions across cultures
- **Ethnic Considerations**: Ethnic-specific naming patterns and traditions
- **Language Expertise**: Language-specific phonetic rules and character sets
- **Religious Context**: Religious naming requirements and taboos
- **Regional Variations**: Local customs within countries and regions
- **Naming Traditions**: Understanding of patronymic, matronymic, and compound naming systems

#### Validation Agent Responsibilities
- **Watchlist Checking**: Validate against criminal/terrorist databases (OFAC, FBI, Interpol)
- **Used Names Prevention**: Check against database of previously accepted names
- **Avoided Names Filtering**: Filter out culturally inappropriate or offensive names
- **Cultural Acceptability**: Ensure names are appropriate for the specific location, culture, and religion
- **Special Naming Requirements**:
  - Mother's and father's names in offspring names (common in some cultures)
  - Hyphenated names due to marriage traditions
  - Patronymic/matronymic naming systems
  - Religious naming conventions and restrictions
- **Regional Compliance**: Verify names follow local legal and cultural requirements

**Swarm Configuration:**
- Maximum 20 handoffs between agents
- 15-minute total execution timeout
- 5-minute timeout per individual agent
- Repetitive handoff detection to prevent infinite loops

### Custom Tools Workflow
The system uses custom Strands tools to enhance name generation and validation:

**Available Tools:**
1. **Domain Availability Checker**: Verifies domain name availability across TLDs
2. **Watchlist Validator**: Checks names against government and industry watchlists
3. **Cultural Context Searcher**: Analyzes cultural meaning and context of names
4. **Trademark Status Checker**: Validates trademark availability in specific industries
5. **Name Variation Generator**: Creates style-based variations of base names

**Tool Integration:**
- Tools are automatically available to all agents in the swarm
- Agents can call tools as needed during name generation process
- Tool results are incorporated into final name recommendations
- Failed tool calls trigger fallback mechanisms

### Questionnaire System
The interactive questionnaire will adapt based on the selected name category:

**Person Names:**
1. What is the person's sex? (Male/Female/Non-binary)
2. What region/country is the person from?
3. What is the person's age range?
4. What is their occupation or persona?
5. What is their cultural/ethnic background?
6. What is their religious background?
7. What year were they born?
8. Do you want a middle name?
9. Any preferences for last name style?

**Project/Product Names:**
1. What is the goal or purpose?
2. What industry or domain?
3. What is the target audience?
4. Any specific themes or concepts?
5. Preferred naming style (descriptive, abstract, etc.)?

**Code Names:**
1. What type of software project?
2. What is the primary functionality?
3. Any security considerations?
4. Preferred complexity level?

**Mission Names:**
1. What type of operation?
2. What is the mission objective?
3. Any operational constraints?
4. Preferred naming convention?

**Place Names:**
1. What type of place?
2. What language/culture?
3. What is the location/region?
4. Any historical significance?

### Validation Sources
- Government watchlists (OFAC, etc.)
- Trademark databases
- Domain name availability
- Social media username availability
- Cultural sensitivity databases
- Existing name databases

### AI Integration

- **Multi-Agent Swarm**: Collaborative agent system for complex name generation tasks
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for external tool access and validation
- **Model Configuration**: Support for multiple Ollama models (llama3, llama2, codellama, etc.)
- **Local Processing**: Run AI models locally for privacy and cost efficiency
- **Fallback Options**: Cloud-based LLM APIs (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude) as backup
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for different name categories
- **Cultural Considerations**: Multi-language and cultural awareness in name generation
- **Multiple Suggestions**: Generate and rank multiple name options with explanations
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Multiple specialized agents working together for comprehensive name analysis
- **External Tool Access**: Real-time validation and data retrieval through MCP tools
